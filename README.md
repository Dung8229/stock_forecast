# Gold Price Forecasting - Final Project (MLOps Zoomcamp)

Welcome to the final project of the **MLOps Zoomcamp** â€“ a complete end-to-end MLOps pipeline to forecast the next day's gold price. This repository implements modern MLOps practices using Prefect, MLflow, AWS, and more.

> ğŸ”— **Project repository:** [github.com/Dung8229/stock\_forecast](https://github.com/Dung8229/stock_forecast/tree/master)

---

## ğŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project forecasts the **next day's closing price** of gold using a simple machine learning model with **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** as a feature. The emphasis is on building a robust and automated MLOps pipeline.

---

## ğŸ”§ Key Components

### âœ… MLflow for Experiment Tracking

* Tracks experiments, parameters, and metrics.
* Registers the best model automatically into the MLflow Model Registry.

### âœ… Prefect for Workflow Orchestration

* Modularized tasks (data loading, feature engineering, training, evaluating, registering).
* Prefect Cloud used for deployment.
* Scheduled to run daily.
* Flow stores:

  * Data & model artifacts â†’ **Amazon S3**
  * Run metadata â†’ **PostgreSQL (Neon remote)**

### âœ… Monitoring with Grafana

* RMSE is monitored via Grafana dashboard.
* Automatic alerts sent (e.g., when RMSE drops below a threshold).

### âœ… Testing

* Unit tests implemented with **pytest**.
* Includes tests for data processing, model logic, and pipeline integrity.

### âœ… Makefile for Automation

* Common commands scripted for easy development and CI/CD tasks:

  * `make train`
  * `make test`
  * `make deploy-flow`
